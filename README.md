gensnomxml.sh
=============

Snom IP phones have a great feature called auto-provisioning. This means that, on startup, the phones consult several locations in the 
hope of receiving their configuration. That configuration can live in XML files.

gensnomxml.sh is an effort to automate the creation of those XML files.
